# c_data_struct_macro_expander
it works sometimes in the end it is a very bad idea to use this
honestly just give up on type safety and use the void* aproach so you do not have to deal with how to structure your header files
you could make this work with some macros maybe keeping track on what and where is defined but that is too much work use void instead
